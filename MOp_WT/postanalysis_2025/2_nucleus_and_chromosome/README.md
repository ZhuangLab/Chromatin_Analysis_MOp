 - **nuclear_chrom_size** includes scripts as follows:

   - 1. selection of cell-nucleus images by cell types to plot.

   - 2. generate figures for the selected cell-nucleus images.

   - 3. summarize nuclear volume by convex hull.

   - 4. plot figures for nuclear volume and its relathionship to transcription.

   - 5. calculate chromosome size.

   - 6. calculate chromosome territory segregation.

   - 7. plot figures for chromosome size and chromosome territory segregation.

   - 8. plot figures for chromosome size and its relathionship to transcription.
