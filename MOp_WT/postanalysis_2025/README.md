   - Implementation of scripts often requires [ImageAnalysis3](https://github.com/zhengpuas47/ImageAnalysis3) or the Zhuang lab archived [source_tools](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/Chromatin_Analysis_2020_cell/tree/master/sequential_tracing/source)


   - In addition, implementation of scripts often requires [AnalysisTool_Chromatin](../functions/)


   - Codebook files in the notebook can be found in the [resource_folder](./0_locus_annotation/resources/).


   - Scripts for generating summarized results for postanalysis in the notebook can be found in the [preprocessing_folder](../preprocess/2_dna_merfish/scripts/2_spot_pick/4_summarize_jie_to_dict.ipynb).


   - External data summary can be found in the [external_resource](../external/).


   - Refer to notebooks for details about when to use the above packages and resources.
