   - 2. summary of cis-chromosomal pairwise contact frequency of single-cells, grouped by genomic ranges.

   - 3. boxplot figures of cis-chromosomal pairwise median distance, contact, and their relationship with chromosome size.

   - 4. scatterplot figures of cis-chromosomal pairwise median distance and its relationship with chromosome size.

   - 5. cis-chromosomal pairwise median distance matrices.

   - 6. scatterplot figures of cis-chromosomal pairwise median distance between cell-type pairs.
